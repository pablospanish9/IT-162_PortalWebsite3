                    is the similar. In government, it is usually an administrative officer or clerk

                    interpretation services. This person usually already has a directory of certified interpreters
                    and translators and usually has a small pool of regulars. They may also call a language agency. 
                    They have a desk job in front of the computer, at work, with a manager or supervisor to report to.

				   	The clients in this category are knowledgeable and generally sophisticated. However they lack 
                    practical knowledge of what it takes to do a translation or interpretation.

                       are not good prospects for doing business with Claudia.
